# AirSign - Advanced Flight Safety System

## Revolutionary Flight Safety Platform with AWS AI Integration

AirSign is a cutting-edge flight safety platform that leverages AWS AI services to predict and prevent aviation emergencies before they happen, providing real-time analysis and emergency response systems to protect lives.

### 🎯 The Problem We Solve

- **60% of engine failures** give 30+ minutes of warning signs
- **Cabin pressure loss** can be fatal in 15-30 seconds without oxygen
- **Current systems** are reactive, not predictive
- **Aviation accidents** often have preventable causes

### 🛡️ Our AWS-Powered Solution

AirSign uses **AWS AI technologies** to:
- **Predict engine failures** 30+ minutes before they happen
- **Deploy oxygen masks** in 20 seconds during pressure loss
- **Guide emergency procedures** with real-time AI recommendations
- **Select optimal airports** for emergency landings

## 🏗️ AWS Architecture

```
Aircraft Sensors → AWS IoT Core → AWS Kinesis → AWS Bedrock → Real-time Alerts
                                                     ↓
AWS SageMaker ← Historical Data ← AWS S3 ← Emergency Procedures
```
